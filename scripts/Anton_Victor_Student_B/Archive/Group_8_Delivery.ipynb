Here, energy consumption is set in relation to turnover, expressed in megawatt hours (MWh) per euro of turnover. The logarithmic scaling of the Y-axis ranges from 100 micro-MWh/EUR to 100 MWh/EUR and thus illustrates significant differences in the efficiency with which companies convert their energy into turnover.\n",

This indicates that this company requires a large amount of energy to generate one euro of turnover - a possible indicator of low energy efficiency.

    "- The **AEX** Index follows closely with a score of 30.24, while the other indices have scores ranging from 31.23 to 54.70.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social responsibility:**\n",
    "- The **CAC-40** index has the highest social responsibility score of 91.16, indicating better gender diversity, lower gender pay gap and greater inclusion of employees with disabilities.\n",
    "- The **MIB** index follows with a score of 76.89, indicating relatively good social responsibility performance.\n",
    "- The other indices have social responsibility scores ranging from 38.37 to 46.43.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall conclusion:**\n",
    "- The **OBX** index excels in environmental responsibility, but lags behind other indices in social responsibility.\n",
    "- The **CAC-40** index excels in social responsibility, while maintaining a moderate level of environmental responsibility.\n",
    "- The **MIB** index shows a balanced performance in both environmental and social responsibility, positioning it as a strong contender overall.\n",
    "- The **AEX**, **BEL-20** and **PSI-20** indices show relatively moderate performance in terms of both environmental and social responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results, stakeholders seeking investments with a strong environmental focus may prefer the **OBX** index, while those prioritising social responsibility may prefer the **CAC-40** index. However, for a more balanced approach, the MIB index could be considered an appropriate choice."

    "\n",
    "- **ROA (Return on Assets)**: This ratio indicates how efficiently a company's management is using its assets to generate earnings. The plots show a mixed behavior; for 'Energy consumption', companies with high ESG ratings (green dots) generally exhibit a variety of ROA values, both high and low. For 'Carbon footprint', the distribution is similar, but there seems to be less variance in the ROA values for ESG leaders.\n",

In the 'Energy consumption' topic, companies with high ESG ratings do not necessarily have the highest ROE; there is a mix, with some high-ESG companies showing higher ROE and some showing lower. The 'Carbon footprint' topic also shows a mixed pattern, with no clear distinction between ESG leaders and non-leaders.\n",

In both topics, companies with high ESG ratings (green dots) are spread across the range of ROIC values.

The performance varies across companies and does not show a clear correlation with ESG ratings in this particular set of data. This suggests that while ESG factors are important for a company's long-term sustainability and risk management, they don't always directly translate to superior financial performance in terms of these ratios, at least not in a uniform way across different companies and industries.\n",
